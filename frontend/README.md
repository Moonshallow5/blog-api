## ⏰Something to note:

I am using the free version of Render. Accoding to the current Terms and Conditions of Render, it says Databases on the free tier will be deleted after 30 days upon creation

Thus, if the project doesn't work and you want to use it, email me on "ssandeepssingh55@gmail.com"


## 💡Inspiration

I still have not implemented a full stack application, till date. Thus, making this was personal for me lol. My first full stack application, utilizing Vue.js, Vuetify for FE. Express.js, JWT for middleware and PostgreSQL for database. 

This whole application has been deployed on Render

## 👀What it does?

Wanting to start a blog for yourself, you can do so by creating new Posts, Viewing and Editing your blog posts. You can also comment on each post as well.


This works by building mutiple API's in Express.js and I built API requests from the FE to them.

## 🔧How I built it?

This was built as part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">Odin Projects</a>, course. Highly recommend it. I have another <a href="https://github.com/Moonshallow5/Odin_Project">github repo </a> for most of my projects done from there. I have now completed the whole course which took approximately 5 months lol.

## 💡What I learnt

- Learnt how to make and configure API requests both in express.js and tested with Postman API.

- Learnt best practices, using router, controllers and model

- Learnt a suitable full stack deploying strategy. However, I should probably look for something else in the future because Render deletes db's pretty quickly sadly.


## 🚧Challenges I ran into

- Deploying it was such a pain :'( I first tried to use Railway, and watch some YouTube videos on how to deploy a middleware but there wasn't many for using Railway thus I switched over to Render

- Learning to deploy 3 applications on Render took about a day, one for PostgeSQL, another for express.js and the third was just Vue

## 🟩Further Improvements

- Build a tab in one of the sections to see all posts which has ever been deployed on the site

- Upgrade UI/UX

- Enable Images to be uploaded in blog posts
